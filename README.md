# web3-mini-projects
I was rusty on Solidity & Web3 front end concepts, so I went through [RareSkill's Beginner Solidity Projects](https://www.rareskills.io/post/beginner-solidity-projects) portfolio with my own implementations. All contracts deployed onto testnets followed with respective frontends.
