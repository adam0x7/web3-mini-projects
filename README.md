# web3-mini-projects
A full implementation of [RareSkill's Solidity Practice Projects](https://www.rareskills.io/post/beginner-solidity-projects) portfolio with my own implementations. All contracts deployed onto testnets followed with respective frontends. These are reference implementations for Solidity noobies learning the language and need help.
